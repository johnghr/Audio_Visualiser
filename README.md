# Audio_Visualiser

This web app allows a user to use their microphone or upload a track to visualise the audio using Waveform and Frequency graphs. 
It is my final project for the CodeClan Professional Software Development course. The app consists of a front-end made using React 
state hooks, Web Audio API and Canvas. The back-end consists of a lightweight server made using Node and Express, and Multer is 
used to store files locally.
